Couple Compatibility Test is actually inspired from the Netflix series 'MisMatched'

I have tried my best to create the clone of the test with few upgrades. This test will ask you some questions to begin with and with the help of answers it will show the compatibility of relationship between the couple. The couple maybe of any group like gays, lesbians, trans and more. It will display your name, your age and your attributes. If the score is below 25%, there is no love between them. If the score is 50% there might be a lil bit of luck. If the score is above 75%, the relationship will workout. In the rare cases, if the score is above 90%, It means they truly love each other and will get the title like, 'SoulMates' or 'Made for each other' or Modern Age Rama and Sita'. 

For now, I have just scratched the surface and done with Frontend partially. 

This project is equipped with MEAN Stack. 

So, for all the young couples out there, check out my website for your compatibility test right away.
